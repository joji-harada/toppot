    <div id="aside">

        <p>It all began in February 2002 out of a small brick storefront on north Capitol Hill in Seattle, Top Pot paired a vintage aesthetic with a gourmet spin on the traditional coffee and doughnuts pairing. </p>

        <h3>Serendipity</h3>
            <div class='fade'><p>Years earlier, two of our co-founders spied a vintage rustic (and rusty) neon sign gleaming above a boarded-up Chinese restaurant called "Topspot". They bought the sign, and then left it idle in a backyard for four years, further rusting and creating a home for raccoons. Then, when the sign was finally driven off to be restored, the center "S" fell off, leaving the words "Top Pot" behind.</p>
            </div>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The sign became Top Pot’s symbol of blending the old with the new. Our founders sought to create a doughnut shop that moved away from the fluorescent-lit fast food aesthetic. Instead, they created an oasis, where patrons could slow down and savor the nostalgia and taste of a secret 1920s doughnut recipe in a gorgeous vintage environment.</p>

        <h3>Success</h3>
            <p>Today, Top Pot Doughnuts can proudly claim a rabid fan base and extraordinary growth. Our hand-forged doughnuts can be found in cafes throughout western Washington and Dallas Texas.</p>
        
        <h3>Commitment</h3>
            <p>We feel so fortunate to have enjoyed such success with a business model that is this much fun. And we remain committed to the simple ideals that brought us this far—quality, inclusiveness, and integrity in every single thing we do.</p>
